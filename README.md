# Entrepôt Optimisé – A Pocket WMS

## Overview

**Entrepôt Optimisé** is a Warehouse Management System (WMS) designed to optimize storage strategies and improve order picking efficiency using data technology. This project addresses issues in existing systems such as inaccurate storage records and inefficient space utilization.

## Key Features

- **Improved Storage Location Strategy:** Uses data collection, cluster analysis, and profit prediction to enhance storage allocation.
- **Optimized Warehouse Storage:** Ensures high-demand items are stocked for timely order fulfillment.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces picking distance and maximizes profit.

## Components

- **Hardware Requirements:** Windows 7/8/10, 4 GB RAM, 2 GB disk space, 1280x800 resolution.
- **Software Used:** Django, Python (3.7), ML algorithms, Google Colaboratory, MS Excel, Sqlite3.

## Methodology

**Receiving & Inspection:**
- Manages staging
- Classifies products
- Predicts profit for optimal storage

**Storage Process:**
- Controls FIFO
- Updates records in real-time
- Manages storage limitations

## Algorithms

- **Multiple Knapsack:** Optimizes bin usage and calculates total profit.
- **Regression:** Predicts product profit.
- **Clustering:** Categorizes data into profit-based clusters.
